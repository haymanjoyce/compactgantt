# Roadmap

Notes on what to work on next.

## REFACTOR

- Remove backward compatibility
- Improve File menu (Excel and JSON file loading and saving)
- The app takes a long time to run some tasks (e.g., adding a swim lane) when there is a moderate amount of data
- Make tasks children of swim lanes (so task order is in context of a swim lane)

## FEATURES

- ID badge collision detection
- Display ID in milestone with associated table (i.e., key)
- Pipes and curtains get their own typography
- Improve pipe and curtain labels
- Drop JSON files altogether (or automate)

## BUGS

- When changing task Finish date, the Start calendar does not update to reflect change immediately
- Some task data (e.g., colours, name position) seem to change when I perform certain operations (e.g. moving a task); check they are not losing association with task ID
